 Some practice before doing the real thing

 The goal is to spend hours making a usable extension (because I'm a total noob), that would save 5 seconds per use, but hey it's good practice and a learning experience, and in the end I'm all about that. Let's go!

 This repo is more or less just a copy of a [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV4L-wcnK3Y "Shoutout to iEatWebsites for great tutorial!")so I can get familiar with some practical coding (instead of just doing some code examples) aswell as wih GitHub!
